Create a Form for displaying Service Note windows
1. In the Service tab for the vending machine, add a button to bring up a form that allows the
vending machine worker to view and create service notes. The notes could be any text that
the worker would like to include made at the time that the machine was serviced: “Nobody
buys Lemon Cola, and there’s never any Orange left”, “There were a lot of slugs in the coin
box”, “Machine always empty, so we should service it more often”, etc.
2. The Service Notes form will be an MDI form (set IsMDIContainer to true).
3. The Service Notes form is a visual container for individual Service Notes. It is not a Service
Note itself.
4. Add a MenuStrip object to the form to implement a simple menu. The menu structure will be
File (which will contain the menu items New Note, Open, Save, and Exit) and Find (which
will contain Filenames).
Create a Form for creating an individual Service Note
5. Create a second new form for holding an individual Service Note.
6. This form will be simply a form with one control: a textbox that fills the entire area of the
form.
7. Add a public property that will allow the text property of the textbox control to be retrieved
and set from outside of this class.
Menu Item event procedures
8. Going back to the Service Notes MDI form, add event procedures to the menu items
8.1. New Note will create a new blank Service Note
8.2. Open will use OpenFileDialog and a new instance of Service Note to display a file
specified by the worker
8.3. Save will use SaveFileDialog to save the contents of a Service Note to a file. Use
ActiveMDIChild to determine which Service Note to save to disk. Note that this menu
item should not be active if there is no Service Note open.
8.4. Exit will close the Service Notes form
8.5. Filenames will use a regular expression to find all of the filenames in all of the open
service notes (this one is optional and described later in this exercise
